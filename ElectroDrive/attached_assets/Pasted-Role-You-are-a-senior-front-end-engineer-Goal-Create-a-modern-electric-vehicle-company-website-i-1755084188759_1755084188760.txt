Role: You are a senior front-end engineer.
Goal: Create a modern electric-vehicle company website (in the style of “BMR EV”) using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript—no frameworks, no backend, no database.

General Requirements

Tech: Pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript (no React/Vue/etc.).

Structure: Multi-page or SPA with router-like hash navigation. Prefer multi-page: index.html, models.html, technology.html, about.html, contact.html.

Files:

index.html, models.html, technology.html, about.html, contact.html

assets/img/ (put placeholder images)

assets/css/styles.css

assets/js/main.js

Use semantic HTML5, accessible markup (ARIA where helpful), responsive layout (mobile‑first), and performance-conscious code.

Do NOT include server code or databases.

Branding (placeholders we will replace later)

Brand name: “VoltEdge Motors” (use this as a placeholder)

Slogan: “Drive Electric. Drive Future.”

Colors (CSS variables in :root):

--brand:#0B8A6A (primary)

--dark:#0E1217

--mid:#1F2732

--light:#F5F7FA

--accent:#12C2A8

Typography: Use system fonts or Google Fonts (e.g., Inter). Provide @import in CSS.

Global UI

Sticky header with transparent → solid on scroll.

Desktop nav + mobile hamburger menu (animated).

Smooth scroll, scroll-to-top button.

Footer with quick links, social icons, and copyright.

Reusable components: Button styles, card, grid, section header.

Pages & Sections

Home (index.html)

Hero: full-bleed image/video placeholder, headline, CTA buttons (“Explore Models”, “Book a Test Drive” → go to Contact section/page).

Key Metrics Strip: range (km), 0–100 km/h, charging time, warranty (cards).

Featured Model Carousel (pure JS): 3–4 EV models with image, price (placeholder), specs chips.

Technology Teaser: battery, motor, connectivity (3 feature cards).

Testimonials (3 cards) with avatars (placeholders).

Callout: “Locate a Dealer” (links to Contact).

Models (models.html)

Filterable grid (JS): body type (Hatch/Sedan/SUV), range tier, price tier (all mock/static).

Each model card: image, name, short spec list, “View Specs” opens a modal with full specs.

Comparison bar: allow selecting 2–3 models to open a comparison table modal (JS‑only, no backend).

Technology (technology.html)

Sections: Battery & Range, Fast Charging, Safety, Connectivity/OTA.

Include simple animated infographic using CSS/JS (e.g., charging animation).

About (about.html)

Story timeline, mission/vision, leadership cards (with placeholder images), sustainability highlights.

Contact (contact.html)

Contact form (name, email, phone, city, message, model interest). Client-side only:

Validation (JS).

On submit, show success toast and open a prefilled mailto: link as fallback.

Dealer Locator (static): city dropdown → shows cards with address, phone, map image placeholder.

JavaScript Features (assets/js/main.js)

Mobile menu toggle, sticky header scroll behavior.

Smooth scrolling for anchor links.

Home carousel (no external libs), autoplay with pause on hover.

Models page:

Filters (buttons/selects) that show/hide model cards.

Spec modal open/close.

Comparison table modal (dynamically builds from a static JS array of models/specs).

Toast notifications (simple, reusable function).

Persist selected filters in localStorage (optional nice-to-have).

Data (Static)

Create a const MODELS = [...] array in main.js with 4–6 demo models:

Fields: id, name, bodyType, price, rangeKm, topSpeed, zeroToHundred, batteryKWh, fastCharge(mins), drivetrain(FWD/RWD/AWD), image.

Use this for the models grid, spec modals, and comparisons.

Design & Effects

Clean, premium EV vibe; glassmorphism touches for cards.

Subtle CSS transitions on hover; reveal-on-scroll animation (intersection observer).

Use SVG icons or inline SVG for spec chips.

Ensure good contrast and keyboard navigation.

SEO & Meta

Title and meta description per page.

Open Graph tags in index.html.

Favicon placeholder in assets/img/favicon.png.

Accessibility

Skip-to-content link.

ARIA labels for nav and modals.

Focus states visible; trap focus inside open modals; ESC to close.

Testing & Docs

Add a README.md with:

How to run locally (open index.html)

How to change logo/photos/colors/text

File structure overview

Comment the code where logic is non-trivial (carousel, filters, modals).

Deliverables

Provide all files with working relative paths.

Use placeholder images in assets/img/ (name them clearly: hero.jpg, model-suv.jpg, etc.).

Ensure no broken links and no external dependencies required to run.
